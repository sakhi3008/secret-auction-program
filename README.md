# Bidding Program 🏆

This is a Python-based console application for managing a bidding process. Multiple users can input their names and bids, and the program will determine the highest bidder.

## Features ✨

- Allows multiple bidders to participate.
- Collects names and bid amounts.
- Determines the highest bidder and announces the winner.
- Clears the console after each bidding entry for a clean display.

## How It Works 📝

- The program takes input from the users (name and bid amount).
- After each bid, it asks if there are more bidders.
  - If "yes," the screen is cleared, and the next bidder can input their details.
  - If "no," the program declares the highest bidder.
- The clear function works both on Windows and macOS/Linux platforms, ensuring a smooth user experience.
